# Snake-Game
I implemented a classic Snake Game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript as part of my frontend development practice. The game includes the following features:

1. Randomized Food Generation: The food appears at random positions on the grid.
2. Dynamic Gameplay: The snake's size increases, and its speed accelerates with each food item consumed.
3. Score Tracking: The game keeps a real-time score based on the player's performance.
4. High Score Display: The highest score is stored and displayed to motivate the player.
5. Collision Detection: The game effectively handles collisions, ensuring the snake's interactions with itself or boundaries result in game-over scenarios.

This project demonstrates my ability to implement interactivity and dynamic updates in web applications using core web technologies.
